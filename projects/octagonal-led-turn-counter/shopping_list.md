# Shopping List

Concrete parts list for the build. DigiKey-first sourcing for authenticity (especially the ESP32-S3, the Mean Well PSU, and the 74AHCT125 — all of which have counterfeits floating around on Amazon).

**What's left over after the build** — the bulk-pack surplus, spare boards, extra strip — is tracked in [inventory.md](inventory.md), so future projects don't re-buy what you already own.

> **Manufacturer PNs are listed below.** They're stable; DigiKey stock numbers can change. Search DigiKey by the manufacturer PN to find the current stock SKU.

## Vendor strategy

| Vendor | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **DigiKey** | ~75% of the BOM. Free ground shipping ≥ $100. Authentic ICs/PSU/connectors. |
| **Amazon** | Seven items: LED strip, aluminum LED channel, JST connector kit, 14 AWG silicone wire (DigiKey-grade Alpha Wire is ~2× the price for the same thing), USB-C data cable, ELEGOO fun kit, and WAGO 221s. |
| **Hardware store** | Wood block, screws, P-clips — cheaper and same-day. |

## On "bundles"

DigiKey doesn't bundle parts kits the way Amazon does. Two workarounds:

- **Single-value bulk packs**: 100× of one resistor or 25× of one Zener is usually cheaper per piece than Amazon assortment kits. Used below for resistors, Zeners, and caps.
- **Manufacturer assortments**: Adafruit "Parts Pal" (~$20) covers most common resistors / caps / diodes / LEDs in one box. Worth it if you want spares for future projects.

### Active components

| Qty | Part | Manufacturer PN | ~$ ea | Notes |
|----:|------|-----------------|------:|-------|
| 2 | ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1, N8R8 | Espressif `ESP32-S3-DEVKITC-1-N8R8` (PCB antenna — **not** the `-1U-N8R8` external-antenna variant) | $15 | N8 and N8R2 are end-of-life at DigiKey; N8R8 is what's stocked. Octal PSRAM uses GPIOs 35/36/37 internally — fine for this build (the pinout doesn't touch those), just don't reassign anything to those pins. Two boards lets the Phase 0 Tap Light survive as a permanent desk lamp. |
| 2 | Level shifter, DIP-14 *(optional)* | TI `SN74AHCT125N` | $0.85 | **Optional** — the build drives the WS2812B directly at 3.3 V (only the first pixel is marginal). Buy it as cheap insurance for the add-back if pixel 1 ever glitches (design doc §3.3), but it isn't populated by default. |
| 1 | 5V / 18A PSU | Mean Well `LRS-100-5` | $18 | Authentic Mean Well — Amazon is full of counterfeits at this price point. LRS-50-5 was the original spec; substituted to LRS-100-5 when the -50 was out of stock at DigiKey. Same series, bigger footprint (~129×97 mm vs 99×82 mm — wood block is still plenty), more headroom. The 5A inline fuse is *more* important now since the PSU itself won't trip on a downstream short. |
| 1 | IEC C14 panel-mount inlet (no switch, no fuse) | Schurter `6100.4315` or equivalent — snap-in panel mount with quick-connect 0.250″ faston tabs | $5 | The original BOM spec'd the integrated Schurter DG12 (switch + fuse + inlet in one unit) but those run ~$46 at DigiKey post-COVID; this discrete approach is ~⅓ the price. |
| 1 | Panel-mount rocker switch, SPST, 20 A @ 125 VAC | E-Switch `RR511D1121` (DigiKey EG4777-ND) | $3 | SPST switches only Line — same approach as every wall switch in your US household. Verify "In Stock" on the listing before ordering (the 13-week lead time only applies if DigiKey is out). 20 A rating is heavy overkill for ~0.5 A AC draw; that's just the smallest part E-Switch makes in this series. 125 V rating works for US 120 V; would not work in 240 V countries. |

**Active components subtotal: ~$58.**

> **Discrete-component AC mains approach:** Wall plug → IEC inlet → SPST switch (on Line only) → PSU's Line input. Neutral runs direct from inlet to PSU's N input; Earth runs direct from inlet to PSU's chassis Earth lug. ~2 extra mains splices vs the integrated DG12. SPST matches standard US household wiring — every wall switch in your house works this way. (The inline blade fuse under Mechanical is the **DC-side** fuse — PSU +5 V output → fuse → Powerpole. Automotive blade fuses are 32 V DC parts and don't belong on the AC line; the LRS-100-5 has its own internal input fuse.)
>
> **Faston terminal note:** the IEC inlet uses 0.250″ quick-connect tabs (industry standard). Either crimp female faston spade terminals onto your AC wires (DigiKey: `WM4040-ND` or similar 22-18 AWG female spades, ~$0.20 ea — buy 6 for L/N/Earth + spares), or solder wires directly to the tabs with heat-shrink. Soldering works fine if you don't have a spade crimper. The switch's terminals are typically also faston tabs — same handling.
>
> **Simpler power alternative — power through the board's USB (design doc §3.5):** because turn_counter lights one side at a time (~0.85 A total), you can run the whole table straight through the ESP32-S3 dev board's USB jack — from a powerbank on the slab or a USB wall adapter — and **skip the PSU, IEC inlet, SPST switch, all three Powerpole pairs, the DC blade fuse, and most of the 14 AWG wire** (~$35 of this order, plus no AC mains work). All you add is the power source and a plain USB cable into the board (no cable-chopping — that's only for the optional full-brightness-all-on split). The firmware's `MAX_POWER_MA` cap (1500) dims just the all-on moments (setup / READY) to fit the board's USB path; normal play stays full-bright. A powerbank source needs an *always-on / low-current* mode.

### Passives — single-value bulk packs

| Qty | Part | Manufacturer PN | Order qty | ~$ |
|----:|------|-----------------|----------:|---:|
| 12 | 1 MΩ, 1/4 W axial resistor | Yageo `CFR-25JT-52-1M0` | 100-pack | $1.50 |
| 5 | 470 Ω, 1/4 W axial resistor | Yageo `CFR-25JT-52-470R` | 100-pack | $1.50 |
| 12 | 1N4728A 3.3 V Zener diode | ON Semi `1N4728ATR` (or Vishay equivalent) | 25-pack | $4 |
| 5 | 1000 µF, 50 V electrolytic capacitor | Panasonic `ECA-1HM102` (DigiKey P5186-ND) | individually (~$1.45 ea; BOM needs 3, +2 spares) | $7.25 |

**Passives subtotal: ~$14.** Buying 100-packs feels excessive but they're $1.50 a pack — cheaper *per piece* than Amazon assortment kits, and you get authentic parts.

### Connectors

JST-XH connectors come from the Amazon kit. Powerpoles + terminal blocks from DigiKey:

| Qty | Part | Manufacturer PN | ~$ |
|----:|------|-----------------|---:|
| 3 | Anderson Powerpole 30 A housing, red | Anderson `1327` | $0.80 ea |
| 3 | Anderson Powerpole 30 A housing, black | Anderson `1327G6` | $0.80 ea |
| 6 | Anderson 30 A contact | Anderson `1331` | $0.80 ea |

> Three Powerpole housing-pairs total: one on the slab, one on the frame side it mates with, one for the bench-test pigtail. (Earlier draft listed 4 pairs; corrected.)
>
> Screw-terminal blocks were dropped — the On Shore Tech OSTYK225/OSTYK223 barrier strips were both out of stock at DigiKey, and WAGO 221 lever connectors (now in the Amazon order) are the cleaner choice for the branching network anyway. See the design doc Phase 6b — WAGOs were already the doc's preferred branching option.

**Connectors subtotal: ~$9.60.**

### Mechanical

| Qty | Part | Manufacturer PN | ~$ |
|----:|------|-----------------|---:|
| 10 | 27 mm piezo disc | Murata `7BB-27-4L0` (or PUI Audio `AB2720B-LW100-R`) | $1.20 ea |
| 1 | Project box, ABS, ~112×62×31 mm | Hammond `1591BBK` | $7 |
| 1 | Half-size breadboard, 400 tie-point | BPS `BB400` (or Twin Industries `400-pt`) | $5 |
| 1 | Protoboard, ~5×7 cm, 0.1" pitch (Phase 0 starter) | Adafruit `1609` (half-size Perma-Proto) or generic | $4 |
| 1 | Protoboard, half-size Perma-Proto, 81×46 mm, 30 cols (main control board) | Adafruit `571` (or a second board from a `1609` multi-pack) | $5 |
| 1 | Inline blade-fuse holder + 5 A blade fuse | Littlefuse `0FHM0001ZXJ` + `0287005.PXCN` | $4 |

**Mechanical subtotal: ~$37.** (Both protoboards are half-size now: the main control board fits 30 columns because the piezo networks live at the discs and the pigtails land directly on the board — no board-mounted piezo JST *headers* (each pair's service JST is inline, off-board). See `doc-src/protoboard_half_layout.svg`; the full-size `protoboard_layout.svg` variant is retired.)

### Wire & consumables

| Qty | Part | Manufacturer PN | ~$ |
|----:|------|-----------------|---:|
| 25 ft (6 colors, mixed) | 22 AWG stranded hookup wire | Adafruit `3111` (6-color **stranded** spool set — not `1311`, which is the solid-core set; the BOM wants stranded for vibration tolerance) | $16 |

**Wire & consumables subtotal: ~$16.** (14 AWG silicone wire moved to Amazon — DigiKey's Alpha Wire is ~$30 for the same length BNTECHGO sells for $16. Rubber grommet for slab cable entry moved to the hardware store — the original Heyco BOM part `2092` is designed for 3 mm sheet-metal panels, not 1″ wood.)

### **DigiKey total: ~$146**

Easily clears the $100 free-shipping threshold.

## Amazon order

| Qty | Search term | ~$ |
|----:|-------------|---:|
| 1 | **"BTF-LIGHTING WS2812B 16.4ft 5m 300 IP30 60leds/m"** (LED strip) | $20 |
| 4-5 sections × 1 m | **"Muzata U01 1m LED aluminum channel with frosted cover"** | $28-35 |
| 1 | **"MUYI JST-XH connector kit 2/3/4/5-pin 530pcs with pre-crimped wires"** | $18 |
| 1 ea | **"BNTECHGO 14 AWG silicone wire 25 ft red"** + **"...black"** | $16 |
| 1 | **"Anker PowerLine USB-C to USB-A 3ft data cable"** (or any known-good USB-C *data* cable) | $10 |
| 1 | **"ELEGOO Electronic Component Fun Kit"** (assorted resistors, caps, LEDs, transistors, diodes) | $18 |
| 1 | **"WAGO 221-415 5-conductor lever connector"** (25-pack) — for branching the slab DC rail into 4 nodes | $10 |
| 1 | **"2.54 mm female pin header 1x40 straight 10 pack"** — cut two 1×22 strips for the ESP32 socket on the control protoboard | $7 |
| 1 | **"M3 nylon standoff assortment kit"** (spacers + screws + nuts) — mounts the control protoboard in the 1591B box | $10 |
| 1 ea | **"BNTECHGO 20 AWG silicone wire 10 ft red"** + **"...black"** — control-board 5V/GND pigtail + rail bridges (14 AWG won't fit protoboard holes; 22 AWG is under the layout's ≥20 AWG spec) | $9 |
| 1 | **"rubber grommet assortment kit"** — control-box cable entries (8 piezo cables + strip harness + power pigtail), plus spares for the slab entry | $8 |
| 1 (optional) | **"DIP-14 IC socket"** (smallest lot) — only needed with the optional 74AHCT125 level shifter (§3.3); skip it for the default direct-drive build | $5 |
| 1 | **"Plasti Dip 14.5 oz can black"** (hardware stores carry it too) — rubber-skin coating for the 8 hardwood corner caps, 3 coats each (§4.2 of the design doc); one can is far more than enough | $9 |
| 2 (optional) | **"Shepherd 7/8 inch screw-on rubber bumpers 4 pack"** (8 total) — mid-side standoffs if the slab flexes when edge-leaned (§4.2) | $8 |
| 1 (optional) | **"135 degree corner guard 4ft"** (Lexan or vinyl, from TheCornerGuardStore / Wallguard / McMaster) — cut into 1"-tall pieces for 8 corner caps, if not making hardwood caps from scrap | $25 |

**Amazon subtotal: ~$163-170 (+ optional rows above as needed — the DIP-14 socket, corner-guard, and bumper rows are all skip-by-default).**

> Female headers don't snap apart cleanly like male ones — cutting destroys one socket position. To get a 1×22, cut through position 23 of a 1×40 (a 10-pack leaves plenty of spares).
>
> **Consolidating the Phase 5 round into one Amazon order:** the half-size Perma-Proto and project box from the DigiKey Mechanical table are also on Amazon — search **"Adafruit 571 Perma-Proto half"** and **"Hammond 1591B"** (~$5 and ~$7). Board-side piezo JST *headers* are no longer needed (pigtails land straight on the board); instead each piezo pair gets an **inline JST-XH 2-pin** off-board for service, and the strip harness gets one **inline JST-XH 3-pin** — 9 in-line pairs total, all from the MUYI kit.
>
> The USB-C cable is for flashing the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1, which ships without one. Many USB-C cables you have lying around are charge-only — confirm data support before flash day. The ELEGOO Fun Kit isn't strictly needed (the DigiKey bulk packs cover this build), but at $18 it's the right call if you'll ever do another project — it's the "I need a 10 kΩ at midnight" insurance. Component values in cheap assortment kits are loosely binned; for any precision-critical use, fall back to the DigiKey passives.
>
> Order 4 sections of channel if your perimeter is exactly 4 m and you're confident in the corner cuts; 5 if you want one spare meter for mistakes (recommended for first build).

## Hardware store (Home Depot / Lowe's / local)

| Qty | Part | ~$ |
|----:|------|---:|
| 1 | Pine 1×6 scrap, ~6" length | $0-3 |
| 1 box | #8 wood screws, 3/4" + 1.5" assortment | $5 |
| 1 pack | P-clips or adhesive cable mounts, mixed sizes | $5 |
| 1 | Soft rubber grommet, ½″ or ⅝″ panel-hole, ID matched to your DC cable OD (the 14 AWG silicone twisted pair is ~5/16″ / 8 mm OD) | $2 |

## Powerpole assembly: solder + heat-shrink (no extra tool)

Decision locked in: skipping the TRIcrimp. Powerpole contacts solder reliably to wire — slower per pair (~5 min vs ~30 sec with the TRIcrimp) but the joint is at least as strong, and you already own the iron.

Process per contact:

1. Strip ~5 mm of insulation off the silicone wire.
2. Tin the wire end and the back of the Powerpole contact.
3. Hold the contact in your helping hands, slide the wire into the cup, reflow with the iron until solder wets both surfaces (~2-3 seconds).
4. Heat-shrink a piece over the joint (cover the contact's barrel and onto the wire insulation).
5. Push the contact into the housing until it clicks (the spring tab locks it in).

You'll do 6 of these total (3 housing-pairs × 2 contacts each). Budget 30-40 minutes the first time.

---

## Tools (Amazon — only if you don't have them)

DigiKey carries Hakko irons and many of these but typically at +20–40% over Amazon. Tools are commodity items where Amazon authenticity is fine.

| Tool | Specific recommendation | ~$ |
|------|------------------------|---:|
| Soldering iron | **Pinecil V2** (USB-PD; great iron at any price) | $30 |
| Solder, 1 lb spool | **Kester `24-6337-0027`** (63/37 leaded, 0.031" rosin core — eutectic, even a touch easier than 60/40) | $30 |
| Side cutters | **Hakko CHP-170** | $8 |
| Wire strippers | **Irwin Vise-Grip 2078300** self-adjusting | $25 |
| Multimeter | **AstroAI DM6000AR** (auto-ranging, capacitance, frequency) | $35 |
| Helping hands | Generic with weighted base + alligator clips | $15 |
| Flux pen | **Kester 951** | $10 |
| Heat-shrink kit | **Eventronic 560pc assortment** | $10 |
| Solder wick | **MG Chemicals 4-25** (3.5 mm × 5 ft) | $5 |
| Silicone bench mat | iFixit ProTech or generic 24×16 silicone | $20 |
| Wire ferrule kit + ratcheting crimper combo | **"IWISS self-adjustable ferrule crimping kit"** (crimper + ~1,200 assorted ferrules AWG 28-10) | $25 |

**Tools subtotal: ~$213.** Full-comfort tier — items chosen so they keep earning their keep on future projects rather than being one-build throwaways. The ferrule crimper is for terminating stranded wire into the PSU's screw-terminal blocks (the LRS-100-5's input/output strips) — bare strands clamped raw will slowly back out under thermal cycling.

## Bench organization (recommended)

The leftover passives, JST kit, wire spools, and heat-shrink will swamp a desk if not corralled. Modest upfront spend (~$100-105) saves hours of "where did I put the 470 Ω resistors" later.

### Essentials

| Item | Specific recommendation | ~$ |
|------|------------------------|---:|
| Compartmented parts cabinet (for passives + small ICs) | **Akro-Mils 10164** (64 small drawers) | $55 |
| Tackle / hardware organizer (for connectors, Powerpole spares, terminal blocks) | **Plano 3700 ProLatch** with adjustable dividers | $15 |
| Pegboard + hooks above the bench | **IKEA SKÅDIS** 22"×22" panel + assorted hooks | $25-30 |
| Solder spool stand | Generic solder spool holder | $5 |

**Bench essentials subtotal: ~$100-105.**

### Optional additions

| Item | Specific recommendation | ~$ |
|------|------------------------|---:|
| Wire spool wall holder (keeps the 14 AWG silicone + 22 AWG spools dispensing cleanly) | search "wire spool wall mount holder" | $15-20 |
| ESD wrist strap (only if you start working with QFN/MEMS-sensitive parts later) | Generic ESD wrist strap | $8 |

### Notes by category

- **Resistors / Zeners**: dump each bulk pack into its own Akro-Mils drawer; label each drawer (you've already got the label maker).
- **Spare ESP32-S3** (after Phase 0 → main project transition leaves zero spare boards): keep in original anti-static bag, labeled drawer.
- **Heat-shrink**: the Eventronic 560-pc kit it ships in is already well-organized — don't decant.
- **WS2812B leftover (~1 m) + channel offcuts**: ESD bag the strip came in, then a labeled gallon zip-bag.

### Skip for now

Rolling tool chests, smart-app parts management systems, anything calling itself "professional grade" at >$200. Bench organization scales fine with a $100 setup until you genuinely outgrow it.

## Cost summary

| Category | Cost |
|----------|-----:|
| DigiKey (parts) | ~$146 |
| Amazon (LED strip + channel + JST + silicone wire + USB-C cable + ELEGOO kit + WAGOs + control-box hardware) | ~$159-166 |
| Hardware store | ~$15-18 |
| **Parts subtotal** | **~$320-330** |
| Tools (skip if owned) | ~$213 |
| Bench organization (recommended) | ~$100-105 |
| **Project total** | **~$633-648** |

**The numbers honestly:** early drafts estimated "$80-120 parts" based on Amazon-everything sourcing with mystery-source kits. Authenticated parts from DigiKey + a real LED channel + spares comes to ~$320-330 (the design doc §2 now carries the same figure). There isn't much more to trim without compromising safety (the IEC inlet) or the build (the LED channel diffuser is what makes the rim look professional vs janky).

If you already own any tools, deduct directly from the ~$213 total — they're all standard bench items. Bench organization is genuinely optional for one project (cardboard boxes work) but pays back fast if this becomes a recurring hobby.

---

## Order sequencing

1. **Hardware store** — same day; nothing depends on slow-shipping vendors.
2. **DigiKey** — place first (1-3 day shipping). Long lead-time risk is the ESP32-S3 (occasionally back-ordered).
3. **Amazon** — place same day as DigiKey; LED strip + channel arrive in 2-3 days.

## Pre-order checklist

Before placing the DigiKey order:

- [ ] Confirm slab dimensions (8 sides × 20" each = 4 m perimeter — order 5 channel sections so you have a spare meter for first-time corner cuts)
- [x] 2 ESP32-S3 boards (keeps Phase 0 Tap Light alive as a permanent desk lamp)
- [x] Powerpole assembly method: solder + heat-shrink (no TRIcrimp)
- [x] Wi-Fi reaches the planned PSU mounting location (OTA path is viable)
- [x] Tools tier: full comfort (~$213; investing in keepers, not throwaways)
