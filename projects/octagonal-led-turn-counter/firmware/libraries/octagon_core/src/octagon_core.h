// Shared table hardware for the octagon: strip geometry, the calibrated
// per-side LED table, adaptive piezo tap detection, and tap dispatch.
//
// Everything here describes the physical table, not any one game — sketches
// layer the rules on top (turn_counter: setup mode + 4 modes; eight: plain
// clockwise passing). Nothing in here touches WiFi or OTA, which is what lets
// a sketch that skips them still fit the stock 1.25 MB app partition.
//
// Targets ESP32-S3 (e.g. ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 N8R8). Piezos live on ADC1
// (GPIO 1-10) so they keep working while Wi-Fi/BLE are active.

                               // 5V path is good for ~1.5-2A, and 1500mA LEDs + ~250mA ESP ~= 1.75A.
