# Inventory

Running record of parts bought for this project and — the point of this file — **what's left over for future projects.** A lot of the BOM came in bulk (100-packs of resistors, a 25-pack of Zeners, a 530-pc JST kit, 5 m of strip for a 4 m build), so the surplus is real. Check here before re-buying.

**How to maintain it:** the counts below are derived from the [shopping list](shopping_list.md) *orders*, not a physical count — reconcile against what actually arrived, then keep the **Spare** column current as you consume parts or restock. When a future project pulls from stock, decrement here and add a line under [Future / added stock](#future--added-stock).

**Where it's stored:** see the shopping list's "Bench organization" section — passives in the Akro-Mils 10164 drawers (labeled), connectors/Powerpole spares in the Plano 3700, strip offcuts in labeled ESD/zip bags.

> Surplus assumes the **Mean Well PSU** power path. If you switch to the **USB powerbank** (design doc §3.5), the PSU, IEC inlet, switch, Powerpoles, DC fuse, and most of the 14 AWG wire all become spare — those rows are tagged ⚡.
