# Octagonal Gaming Table Turn Counter

LED rim turn counter for a removable octagonal gaming table that sits on top of a bumper pool table. Players tap the lit section in front of them to pass turn; the lit zone advances clockwise to the next player.

**Start with [`design_doc_simple.md`](design_doc_simple.md)** — the current default build: USB-powered, everything on the lid, no mains wiring. The full mains-powered / permanent-install version — complete BOM, wiring schematics, mechanical drawings, and phased checklist — is in `turn_counter_design_doc.pdf` (source: `turn_counter_design_doc.md`), kept as the advanced reference.

## Firmware

### Arduino IDE

Open the `.ino` files in Arduino IDE.

- Board: **ESP32S3 Dev Module** (Tools → Board → ESP32 Arduino → ESP32S3 Dev Module), upload speed 921600
- Tools → **USB CDC On Boot: Enabled** (so `Serial.println` reaches the IDE over the native USB port)
- Required libraries: FastLED, ArduinoOTA (ArduinoOTA bundles with the ESP32 core)
- The ESP32-S3 enumerates over native USB — no CP210x/CH340 driver needed
- Wi-Fi credentials, mDNS hostname and OTA password live in `firmware/turn_counter/secrets.h` — copy `secrets.example.h` to it and fill it in. That file is gitignored; without it the sketch still builds and just runs with the radio off

### arduino-cli (no IDE needed)

`arduino-cli` reuses the IDE's installed cores and libraries (macOS: `~/Library/Arduino15` and `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`), so there is no separate setup and it produces the same binaries.

```bash
brew install arduino-cli    # macOS; other platforms: arduino.github.io/arduino-cli

arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3 firmware/strip_test
arduino-cli upload  -p /dev/cu.usbserial-1130 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3 firmware/strip_test
arduino-cli monitor -p /dev/cu.usbserial-1130 -c baudrate=115200
```

- Find your port with `arduino-cli board list` or `ls /dev/cu.*` (the port number varies with USB topology — `-1130`, `-140`, etc.). The board has two USB ports: the **UART** port (CP2102 bridge) enumerates as `/dev/cu.usbserial-*` and is the one to flash through; the board's **native-USB** port would show up as `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` — but so do unrelated USB devices (hubs, monitors), which is why the `usbserial-*` entry is the unambiguous choice on a busy Mac.
- `turn_counter` overflows the default 1.25 MB app partition (Wi-Fi + OTA + mDNS), so plain `esp32:esp32:esp32s3` fails to link with "text section exceeds available space". Compile **and upload** it with `--fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3:PartitionScheme=min_spiffs` (1.9 MB app slots, keeps the OTA partition). `tap_light` and `strip_test` fit the default scheme fine (~52%).
- Default board options leave **USB CDC On Boot disabled**, so `Serial` output arrives on the same `usbserial-*` UART port you flash through — no IDE setting to remember. To instead match the IDE configuration above (serial over the native-USB port), compile with `--fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32s3:CDCOnBoot=cdc`.
- The CLI builds *sketch folders*, not bare `.ino` files — every sketch under `firmware/` has its own folder.

### Make shortcuts

The `Makefile` wraps the commands above with the port auto-detected from `/dev/cu.usbserial-*` (override with `make <target> PORT=/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX`):

```bash
make flash-hello    # compile + upload the connection smoke test
make flash-strip    # compile + upload the WS2812B strip test
make flash-tap      # compile + upload the Phase 0 tap light
make flash-turn     # compile + upload turn_counter (applies the min_spiffs partition)
make ota            # compile turn_counter and push it over Wi-Fi instead of USB
make map-piezos     # reassign piezos to sides by tapping each lit side
make qr URL=...     # printable QR sticker pointing at the table's web UI
make monitor        # serial monitor at 115200 (Ctrl+C to quit — frees the port for uploads)
make compile-all    # build everything without touching the board (verbose + all warnings)
make test           # run the host-script test suite (no board needed)
make ports          # list connected boards
make pdf            # rebuild all doc PDFs (design, simple, dry-run, tap-light, bench guide)
make vscode         # regenerate .vscode IntelliSense config from the installed toolchain
make upgrade        # arduino-cli core+lib upgrade, then vscode regen + compile-all
```

Only one program can hold the serial port — quit `make monitor` before any `flash-*` target.

**If a tap lights the wrong seat**, run `make map-piezos`. Each side lights white in turn; tap that seat. The corrected map is stored on the board (NVS), so it survives reboots and OTA and needs no reflash — no wire tracing either.

**`make ota`** pushes over Wi-Fi instead of USB. It needs `firmware/turn_counter/secrets.h`, and the board must already be running firmware that joined the network — so the first flash after setting credentials is always a USB one. Use `make ota HOST=192.168.x.x` if mDNS won't resolve `turn-counter.local`.

### Phone control

With Wi-Fi configured, the table serves a control page on port 80: game mode, LED brightness, and an on/off switch, plus live status showing whose turn it is and who's seated.

- **iPhone/iPad**: `http://turn-counter.local/`
- **Android**: use the IP. Android has no system-wide mDNS resolver, so `.local` won't resolve. Give the board a DHCP reservation on your router so the address stops moving — the firmware prints its MAC at boot for exactly this.
- **Guests**: `make qr URL=<address>` prints a sticker for under the table.

There's no authentication. Anyone who can reach the table can change these three settings — at a game table that's the point — and nothing destructive is exposed.

Off is separate from brightness: the LEDs go dark but mode, roster, whose turn it is and everyone's ready flags are all preserved, and brightness keeps its value. It isn't persisted, so the table always boots lit. To wake it without a phone, tap one side four times quickly — the same burst that opens setup while it's lit.

## Rebuilding the PDF

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9 or newer**
- **WeasyPrint native libraries** (Pango, Cairo, GDK-PixBuf, libffi, HarfBuzz). Install varies by platform:
  - **macOS**: `brew install pango python` (Cairo and the rest come along as dependencies). On Apple Silicon, **use Homebrew's Python** (`/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`) to create the venv below — Apple's stock `/usr/bin/python3` can't find Homebrew's libraries at runtime and fails with `OSError: cannot load library 'libgobject-2.0-0'`. As a fallback if you must use a non-Homebrew Python, run with `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib python3 doc-src/build_pdf.py`.
  - **Debian / Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install libpango-1.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0`
  - **Windows**: install the GTK3 runtime — follow [WeasyPrint's Windows guide](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html#windows)
  - Other platforms / troubleshooting: [WeasyPrint first steps](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html)

### Build

From the repo root, in a virtual environment (required on systems with PEP 668, including recent Homebrew Python on macOS and Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 doc-src/build_pdf.py            # design doc  → turn_counter_design_doc.pdf
python3 doc-src/build_dry_run_pdf.py    # dry run     → dry_run.pdf
```

> Windows users: substitute `py` for `python3` in the commands above.

`build_pdf.py` reads `turn_counter_design_doc.md` from the root and the SVGs from `doc-src/`, then writes `turn_counter_design_doc.pdf` back to the root. `build_dry_run_pdf.py` reads `dry_run.md` and writes `dry_run.pdf`. Both share the stylesheet in `doc-src/doc_style.py`, so the two PDFs stay visually consistent — edit styling there once.

## Editing the doc

The markdown supports tables, fenced code, definition lists, and HTML attribute lists. SVGs are read fresh on each build (no cache). Rebuild before committing.
